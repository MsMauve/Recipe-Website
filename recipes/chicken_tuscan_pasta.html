    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This was one of the first dishes I ever cooked for Andy 
        and Kellen. Making it was nerve-wracking, 
        but this succulent blend of spinach, chicken, bacon, 
        parmesan, and more is to date the only dish I've ever 
        cooked that made Stacy-Anne cry.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Spices: Salt, Pepper, etc.</li>
        <li>Fettucine: 12 oz.</li>
        <li>Bacon: 1 pkg, chopped</li>
        <li>Chicken: 1 lb., cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>Garlic: 2 cloves, minced</li>
        <li>Heavy Cream: 1 cup</li>
        <li>Baby Spinach: 5 oz.</li>
        <li>Parmesan: grated, 3/4 cup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the fettuccine according to package directions; drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, put the bacon in a large, cold skillet, then cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until crispy, about 8 minutes; transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle the chicken lightly with salt and pepper and add to the skillet in a single layer. Let cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on the underside, 2 to 3 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 4 minutes more. Transfer to the plate with the bacon</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the cream and bring to a simmer, then add the spinach and stir until just wilted. Add the bacon, chicken, fettuccine and Parmesan and toss with tongs until well coated; season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve.</li>
