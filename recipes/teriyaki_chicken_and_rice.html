    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Once I had a couple solid pasta dishes 
        under my belt, I figured it was time 
        to expand my palette, and my partners' 
        alongisde me! This tangy chicken goes 
        best with sticky white rice and 
        your fave veggie!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Brease: 2 lbs., cut</li>
        <li>Sesame Seed Oil: 1 tbsp.</li>
        <li>Garlic: 2 cloves, peeled and crushed</li>
        <li>Ginger: 1 tsp., pureed</li>
        <li>Cornflour: 2 tsp</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce: 100mL</li>
        <li>White Wine Vinegar: 2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Honey: 3 tbsp</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the teriyaki sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Begin with the cornflour and gradually add the soy sauce, whisking so there are no lumps. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan until very hot.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and cook for about 10-15 minutes until the chicken is almost cooked through.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 3 or 4 more minutes until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the teriyaki sauce ingredients and cook for about 5 minutes until everything is well coated and thickened.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, I cook some rice in the bottom of a steamer pan and then add some green vegetables to the steamer part on top for the last 5 minutes. (You can mix the cooked broccoli into the sauce and chicken just before serving if you'd like it coated in sauce.)</li>
    </ol>
